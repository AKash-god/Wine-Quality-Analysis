# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis  

This project analyzes the *Wine Quality Dataset* and builds machine learning models to predict wine quality based on its physicochemical properties (e.g., acidity, alcohol, pH, sugar).  
The goal is to assist wine producers, retailers, and researchers in assessing wine quality objectively.

## 📌 Project Workflow  
1. *Data Preprocessing* – handling missing values, feature scaling, and cleaning.  
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* – statistical analysis and data visualization.  
3. *Feature Engineering* – creating and selecting relevant features.  
4. *Model Building* – training classification/regression models.  
5. *Model Evaluation* – using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score.  
6. *Result Interpretation* – insights into which factors most influence wine quality.
